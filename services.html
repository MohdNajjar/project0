    <span class="spage-para-header">LEED Certification Project Management</span>
    My experience with the LEED process enables design and construction teams to successfully and efficiently use the USGBC’s LEED Green Building Rating System. As a hallmark of the sustainable approach, I recommend collaborative design charrettes early in the process to promote holistic thinking.

  <p class="spage">
    <span class="spage-para-header"> EDGE Certification </span>
    Starting from the early stage of design through construction, as an EDGE Expert, I assure compliance of your building to achieve higher saving percentages of Energy, Water and Materials.
    EDGE reveals the systems and solutions that work best for your climate, bringing international cachet to your certified project without losing the local context and increases the marketability of your green building.

  <p class="spage">
    <span class="spage-para-header"> ESTIDAMA Certification </span>
    If your project is located in Abu Dhabi or any other emirate in UAE and you are seeking compliance or certification in PCRS, PBRS or PVRS. Then, collaborating with the project teams to achieve a high level of sustainability in a most appropriate and value-adding manner. In addition to conducting regular meetings with the UPC - ESTIDAMA team, contractor and subcontractor to make sure that they are all complying with the requirements and achieving the required Pearl level for the project in the most economical means.

    <span class="spage-para-header">In addition to many other rating systems </span>
    Dealing with all local green buildings design and construction rating systems and regulations, like Assafat in Dubai, GSAS in Qatar and the Jordan Green Building Guide.

  <p class="spage">
    <span class="spage-para-header">Planning and developing Net Zero Energy (NZE) buildings</span>
    The approach to a NetZero building encompasses three main steps applied to Energy, Water and Materials:
    1-	Reduce Resources
    2-	Reuse Resources
    3-	Offset Remaining
  </p>
  <p class="spage">
    <span class="spage-para-header">Energy Modeling</span>
    Using Revit and eQuest; performing the key computations needed to quantify the strengths of different design options that will be useful throughout the project. Early energy modelling is critical to successful and cost-effective sustainable design.
  </p>
  <p class="spage">
    <span class="spage-para-header">Daylight Simulation</span>
    Using Revit, daylight analysis can be performed in a separate study than energy modelling, best to be at the early schematic stage to prove the best building orientation and other passive design decisions.
  </p>
  <p class="spage">
    <span class="spage-para-header">Training and Coaching</span>
    Training design professionals in the use of USGBC’s LEED Rating System, ESTIDAMA Rating System, EDGE and other rating systems. In addition to general or special topics sessions in sustainability.
